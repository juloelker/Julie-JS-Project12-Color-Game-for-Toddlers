# Julie-JS-Project12-Color-Game-for-Toddlers

This is a redesign of the incredibly basic event handler project, Julie-JS-Project9-Events Simplest.  In that one, I had some ugly HTML, no real CSS, and a JS file that can change the background color to a random new color when the Submit button is clicked.  

In this one, I am taking that color changer and creating a simple game that will cycle through the colors of the rainbow when the kid (who can't read yet) clicks the button.  

User story:
As a little kid, when I click the button, I get a pretty color, the first color of the rainbow.  When I click the button again, I get the next color.  Every time I click, I get the next color in the rainbow.  
Given: a kid with no reading skills,
When: the kid clicks the button repeatedly,
Then: the background color changes, cycling through the colors of the rainbow in order: red, pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple.

As of 3/15/2021, this is not working yet.  It's my first pass at writing an event-driven function to show each color to a young child in rainbow order.  
I thought of it because my granddaughter, who is 2 1/2, has just learned her colors, and she loves holding up objects and announcing the color.

Future enhancements: 
audio to tell the kid to click the button, 
audio to tell the name of the color when it changes,
cute sound effect when the color changes, 
background music
transition between colors, 
cute animation at the end after the last color is displayed
